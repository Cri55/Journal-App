# Journal-App
Google ALC Challenge. The first version of the app was built focusing on the ui of the "Journey app"
on playstore, i had lots of speed bumps and after getting stuck for so long on setting a custom listView for a fragment, i decided to build version 2.0, which contains the same code but with different activities.
users, must first login to access the features of the app using their google accounts.
